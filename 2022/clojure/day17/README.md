# Day 17

Advent of Code 2022 `Falling Rocks`. This one was a lot of fun, except that I ran into a bug
that caused me to waste hours, having to do with raising the floor. Apparently there is some
weird state where a down line shape can get behind and under the rocks...took a while to isolate.
Using REPL definitely helped, all was good in the end.
