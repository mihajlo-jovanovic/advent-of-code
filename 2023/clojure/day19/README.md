# day19

This one took me a long time...first I tried generating the accepted? predicate in code; that 
ultimately worked for test input but not for the main one (ran into 64kb sizs limit). Fortunately
was able to modify same meta-programming function to a predicate. 

For Part 2, took me forever to write a recursive function that produces constraint ranges. Copilot 
was helpful in generating code that calculates number of combinations.

All in all, fun one but a doozy!
