;; Graph Topological Sort
;;
;; The topo-sort function here performs a toplogical sort of the graph.  A
;; topological sort returns a list of nodes in dependency order. In our case, a
;; graph is represented as a collection of directed edges, each of which is a
;; two element vector with the "from node" and the "to node":
;;
;;     (topo-sort #{[:a :b] [:b :c] [:a :c]})
;;     => [:a :b :c]
;;
;; The nodes need not be keywords. They can be anything that can be compared
;; for equality.
;;
;; We use Kuhn's algorithm (source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting)
;;
;;     L ← Empty list that will contain the sorted elements
;;     S ← Set of all nodes with no incoming edge
;;     while S is non-empty do
;;         remove a node n from S
;;         add n to tail of L
;;         for each node m with an edge e from n to m do
;;             remove edge e from the graph
;;             if m has no other incoming edges then
;;                 insert m into S
;;     if graph has edges then
;;         return error (graph has at least one cycle)
;;     else
;;         return L (a topologically sorted order)
