# Day 14

Advent of Code Day 14 "Sand flow in a cave"

## Usage

```
$ lein uberjar
$ java -jar day14-0.1.0-standalone.jar
```

## Notes

This one was fun to do in Clojure. It took me a while as I missed a 
few edge cases for each part...kind of a reminder why sometimes 
you need to go slow (i.e. right tests) in order to go fast.
