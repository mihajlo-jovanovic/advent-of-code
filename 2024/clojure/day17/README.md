# Day 17 - Chronospatial Computer

This one was hardest for me thus far. Spent a tone of time on this one. In the end, key piece of 
insight (which I had to look up) was reverse-engineering the program, by writing a backtracking
recursive function. Even with that piece of insight still took me a quite a while to get the
backtracking right. Initially I had tried to find just the first match at each level, but that didn't
as some levels had multiple matches only some of which i=ultimately led to the solution.

I am intentionally leaving the function signature quite messy, there are obvious ways to clean up. But this thing already sucked up enough of my time. On to the next puzzle...
