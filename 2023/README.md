# advent-of-code-2023

Yes, this year I've decided to once again stick with a mix of Clojure & Rust.

`clojure` dir contains solutions in Clojure for days where I felt the language is more appropriate tool
(plus I probably also got tired of wrestling with the Rust borrow checker ;-)

### Day 1

Harder ttahn usual day 1 problem. Finally got it working in Rust, although code is not much to look at - 
lots of duplication. Started re-factoring to make use of built-in matches_indices, not sure if or when I'll 
get to it...
