# Day 4

This was a fun puzzle to solve in Clojure. Still a bit rusty so took me a while to get the hang of how to parse input. I ended up manually removing 
`Card X:`` prefix, just because...

Also, probably should've used maps instead of vectors for pairs of [id, num-of-winnings]. And nested reduce invocations are not great.

But it:
- works
- functional (no for/if-else crap)
- fairly concise (~50 LoC)
