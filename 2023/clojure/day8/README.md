# Day 8

Another fun one to do in Clojure! Part 1 was straight-forward; totally fell for part 2 brute force and saw a few stack overflows.
One thing I'm still not clear on is why, as recur should be using tail recursion?

Things that could be improved:
- single parse-input function for both map and instructions
- p1 & p2 are basically the same but for the predicate; can be passed in as argument

Still, ~50 LoC is fairly concise. Clojure/Lisp just rock!
