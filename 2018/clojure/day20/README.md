# Day 20 - A Regular Map

Interesting one having to do with regular expressions and Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs).
Had to brush up on things like Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA), Thompson construction, 
Kleene Star (*). Also, how to write a tokenizer and a parser. After that, it was pretty smooth sailing. 

Ended up with ~100 LoC in Clojure. Not too bad, although I must admit it took me a while.
